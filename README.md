# vogel iiif server

vogel is a modified version of [potto](), which is itself an alternative deployment for [loris](https://github.com/loris-imageserver/loris). it is designed to run in [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) and serve images stored in [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) as a [iiif compliant](http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/) image server.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

### Installing
clone the repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/watzek/vogel.git
$ cd vogel
```
install dependencies:
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Development
coming soon!
## Deployment
### Configuration
ensure that environment variables are set in AWS EB control panel:
- `SOURCE_ROOT` s3:// URL to s3 bucket and prefix where images are stored

optionally, set the following:
- `CACHE_ROOT` default `/cache` in loris app directory
- `LOG_LEVEL` default `INFO` of CRITICAL | ERROR | WARNING | INFO | DEBUG	| NOTSET - output goes to `/var/log/httpd/error_log` which gets shipped by default when you request logs from beanstalk.

### Uploading
check the environment names and versions already in beanstalk:
```sh
$ ./beanstalk-describe.sh
#
# '--version-label's (last 20 version names already used)
# ...
#
# '--environment-names's
# ...
```
you can zip and upload a new version with `deploy-version.sh vX.Y.Z env-name`, e.g.
```sh
$ ./deploy-version.sh v1.6.2 vogel-prod
```
note that you can't deploy on top of an existing version - you need to either delete it from the aws eb console, or bump the version number up.

version zipfiles are stored in the same s3 bucket currently used to serve images (`vogel-iiif`).
